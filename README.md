Inspiration
In today's fast-paced world, students often struggle with processing information from various formats quickly and efficiently. With the rise of online learning, we noticed that students needed a tool that could make their studying experience more productive, whether it's by transcribing lectures or summarizing complex visual data. This inspired us to create SpeakScribe, a platform designed to help students by converting speech to text and summarizing images, so they can focus on learning instead of manual note-taking.

What it does
SpeakScribe converts speech to text for students that can have notes all done without struggling to catch up. SpeakScribe also can convert an image into a summary for the Students to review and understand.

How we built it
We developed SpeakScribe using a combination of Python for backend processing and for the front end we used React.

Challenges we ran into
One major challenge we ran into was installing all of the packages for python. We coded the speech to text in python and downloading all the packages was challenging. Also incorporating already trained AI models into our program was difficult because there were a lot of bugs.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to create a tool that can handle both speech-to-text and image summarization. We are proud of being able to execute and create an app. We are proud of gaining the important skills and knowledge that we gained along this journey.

What we learned
What we learned Throughout this project, we learned how to use API keys and change and incorporate the AI to our advantage. We also learned how to use the Speech function and make it work in real time, for the website to convert quickly. Additionally, we gained important skills of collaboration, teamwork and time management.

What's next for SpeakScribe
What's next for SpeakScribe We plan to add more features to SpeakScribe like being able to generate summaries from long lectures, and adding different languages to SpeakScribe. We also want the summary feature to be able to read charts and graphs to help students better.
